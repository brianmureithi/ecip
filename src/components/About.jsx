      E.C.I.P, which stands for Esther Children's Integrated Program, is a charitable organization
       founded by Esther Nzioka, a former social worker and trained counselor with over a decade of experience
        in assisting vulnerable groups such as orphans, widows, teenage mothers, and people with HIV. Esther's perception of 
        the world changed significantly following a life-changing event she experienced while on duty.
         One night, a snake entered a dilapidated house where three orphaned children were sleeping,
         and only the timely intervention of a passing Good Samaritan saved their lives. Unfortunately,
          the youngest child, a three-year-old boy, lost three fingers that became infected.
           This incident highlighted the urgent need for support and care for orphans
            who are particularly vulnerable to various challenges. According to Lee et al. (2014), 
            an estimated 3.6 million children under 18 years of age are orphans or vulnerable.

E.C.I.P is a non-profit organization that focuses its operations primarily in Tharaka-Nithi county, an area that has been severely impacted by the HIV epidemic,
 resulting in many children being orphaned. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a significant impact on the region, with many people struggling to meet their basic needs.

In response to these challenges, ECIP provides support to orphans by addressing their physical, psychological, and social needs through a range of services, 
including counseling, emergency response, and care. The organization aims to improve the well-being of these children holistically by providing them with meals and 
addressing their mental health needs, among other things.
