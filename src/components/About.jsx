      E.C.I.P is a noble organization that was founded by Esther Nzioka, a compassionate ex-social worker and a trained counsellor with over a decade of experience in 
      helping orphans, widows, and persons with HIV. However, Esther experienced a life-changing event while on duty, which had a profound impact on her and the way she 
      perceives the world. One night, a snake entered a dilapidated house where three orphaned children slept, and only the intervention of a well-wisher on her
       way to run errands saved the children's lives. Unfortunately, the youngest child, a three-year-old boy, lost three fingers that became infected. 
       As per Lee et al. (2014), an estimated 3.6 million children below 18 years of age are orphans and/or vulnerable. ECIP's main objective is to sensitize 
       the community by supporting orphans' welfare through capacity building, care, support, and psychological counseling. Thank you for considering supporting 
       this worthwhile cause.
